'''
Exercise to practice Python lists.

Imagine there is a new pastry shop in your city 
and you are helping them organize some data.
'''
# To keep track of the kinds of pastries you sell, 
# create a list called pastries
pastries = ['croissant', 'bizcocho', 'cherry pie', 'pecan pie', 'empanada', 'mille-feuille', 'cannoli']

# To keep track of how much each kind of pastry costs, 
# create a list called prices 
prices = [12.99, 16.99, 8.99, 2.99, 8.99, 14.99, 18.99]

# Find the number of pastries that cost 8.99 dolars
num_eight_dollars_pastries = prices.count(8.99)
print(num_eight_dollars_pastries)

# Find the number of pastries in the menu
num_pastries = len(pastries)
print('We sell', num_pastries,'different kind of pastries!')

'''Use the existing data about the pizza toppings 
and prices to create a new two-dimensional list called 
pastries_and_prices. For this new list make sure the 
prices come before the pastry name.

Note: You donâ€™t need to use your original pastries 
and prices lists in this exercise. Create a new 
two-dimensional list from scratch.
